This folder contains the Swift port of the Brick Crusher game, built with SpriteKit.

Quick Start (Xcode)
1. Open `ios/BrickCrusher/BrickCrusher.xcodeproj` in Xcode.
2. Select an iPhone simulator or device.
3. Build and run.

Gameplay
- Tap to start from the splash screen.
- Drag horizontally to move the paddle.
- Bricks fall in rows from the top; if they reach the paddle line, game over.

Notes
- Bundle ID defaults to `com.example.BrickCrusher` in the project settings.
